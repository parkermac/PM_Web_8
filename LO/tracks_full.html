      <h3> Particle tracks from the surface flow for the most recent 14 days - through the end of today's three-day forecast. </h3>
      <p> Touch, on the the map to see individual clusters of tracks.  The lines show where surface drifters released near that point in the model travelled over the past two weeks.  The lines grow thicker and redder over their distance/time.</p>
      <p>By exploring patterns over the whole map you can find important features of Pacific Northwest coastal circulation.  In the winter, when storms often bring southerly winds, drifters travel toward the coast and then far to the north, riding the plume of fresher water from the Columbia River and other coastal rivers.  In the summer, when we often have light winds from the north, drifters travel away from the coast to the southwest.  Colder water is upwelled at the coast to replace what flows offshore, bringing with it the nutrients that feed phytoplankton growth.</p>
