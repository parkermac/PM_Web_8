<p> The Pogo Foil is a human-powered hydrofoil boat with a flapping wing propulsion system.&nbsp; In the photo above, my wife, Molly Knox, is riding/flying it on Green Lake in Seattle in  1990.&nbsp; It weighs about 50 lbs, goes over 11 mph, but is only good for a few hundred meters before the rider/pilot gets tired out.&nbsp; The Pogo Foil is the culmination of several years of experimental boat building, which included the &quot;Mutiny on the Boundary Layer,&quot; the overweight over-mechanical, but working, predecessor to the sleeker Pogo Foil. </p>
<p> The boat rests on pontoons at the start, and then the rider starts hopping up and down (hence the &quot;pogo&quot;).&nbsp; The vertical motion causes the main hydrofoil below the pilot to start to make thrust.&nbsp; This main wing is made of a carbon/epoxy composite, is about 2 m in span, uses a NACA 4415 airfoil section, and pivots just ahead of the quarter chord.&nbsp; The pivoting is controlled by a lever arm to a nonlinear spring aboveboard.&nbsp; The springiness controls how much thrust you get.&nbsp; As you gain speed the front, smaller foil pushes the nose of the boat up.&nbsp; When 'flying' the depth of the front foil is controlled by a little spatula on a lever arm which rides along the surface of the water and actuates the elevator flat on the front foil.&nbsp; The front foil is steered by the handlebars, and when you are flying you balance the craft just like a bike.&nbsp; As you gain speed you lean forward, and then in a magical and difficult-to-master moment the craft rotates up, the hulls pull clear of the water, and you are flying.&nbsp; Then your weight is fully carried by the hydrofoils, which remain 10-30 cm below the water surface.&nbsp; It is an amazing feeling to fly the craft, I imagine that it is a bit like a goose feels taking off from a pond and skimming low along the water. </p>
<p>I don't sell them, and it's not patented.&nbsp; A group in Sweden independently invented an almost-identical device called the Trampofoil, not long after mine.&nbsp; They were selling them, but may not be anymore.&nbsp; I was motivated to start working on such devices while I was an aero engineer at <a href="http://www.aerovironment.com">AeroVironment, Inc.</a>, my dad's company in Monrovia, CA.&nbsp; We were building an 18 ft span flying-flapping pterodactyl replica.&nbsp; I was working with Alec Brooks and Alan Abbott, who created the amazing Flying Fish human-powered hydrofoil.&nbsp; The Pogo Foil is modeled after the Fish, but uses a flapping foil instead of a propeller.&nbsp; Yes, my dad is Paul MacCready who invented the Gossamer Condor and Albatross.&nbsp; We have raced the Pogo Foil and its predecessor at International Human Powered Vehicle Association (<a href="http://www.ihpva.org">IHPVA</a>) races in Vancouver BC and Portland Oregon.&nbsp; I built the earlier boat, the Mutiny, while I was a grad student with Ted Wu at <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>.&nbsp; Ted has done some great work predicting what sort of flapping motion you need for optimum propulsive efficiency.&nbsp; The Pogo Foil is not very efficient compared to either theory or a propeller.&nbsp; But there is lots of room for improvement by motivated inventors and scientists!&nbsp; Nature has much to teach us.</p>
