# README for PM_Web_8

### This is a new version of my website.  It starts as a copy of PM_Web_7, and I will manage it in Dreamweaver for now, including using existing templates.  The main difference will be in publication: I will not use the Dreamweaver tool for pushing it to homer, but will instead save it as a Git repo and pull from homer.

First I copied it, made the repo, and published.

Then in Dreamweaver I used Site -> New Site... and pointed to this folder.  I did not add a server.
